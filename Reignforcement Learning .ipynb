    "# Reinforcement Learning (RL)\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an **agent** learns how to make decisions by interacting with an **environment** to achieve a goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "1. **Agent**: The learner or decision-maker (e.g., a robot, a program).\n",
    "2. **Environment**: The world the agent interacts with.\n",
    "3. **Actions**: The choices the agent can make.\n",
    "4. **States**: The situation the agent is in.\n",
    "5. **Reward**: Feedback from the environment for an action (positive for good actions, negative for bad actions).\n",
    "6. **Policy**: The strategy the agent uses to decide actions based on states.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works:\n",
    "1. The agent takes an **action** in the environment.\n",
    "2. The environment responds with a **new state** and a **reward**.\n",
    "3. The agent adjusts its **policy** to maximize the total reward over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "Imagine teaching a dog a trick:\n",
    "- **Agent**: The dog.\n",
    "- **Environment**: The room where the dog is learning.\n",
    "- **Action**: Sit, stand, roll over.\n",
    "- **Reward**: A treat when the dog does the trick correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, the dog learns to perform the trick (maximize rewards) by understanding which actions result in treats.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning is like trial and error, where the agent improves by learning from the consequences of its actions.\n"
